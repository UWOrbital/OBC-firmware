/** @brief Whether the POSIX-like API should follow symbolic links.

    When the POSIX-like API is provided with a path whose resolution requires
    following a symbolic link, then:
    - If this setting is enabled, the POSIX-like API will follow the link, using
      its internal implementation.
    - If this setting is disabled, the POSIX-like API will return an error and
      set #red_errno to #RED_ENOLINK.  This is useful if following symbolic
      links needs to be externally implemented, in the VFS.

    If #REDCONF_API_POSIX or #REDCONF_API_POSIX_SYMLINK are false, then this
    setting has no effect.

    The ::VOLCONF array was originally intended to be read-only; however, in

/** @brief Whether RedOsFakeUidGid() is implemented by the OS services.

    Implementing RedOsFakeUidGid() is optional.  If implemented, it is used by
    test code to override the user ID and group ID with test values.  This
    allows testing functionality that otherwise could not be tested.

    Since RedOsFakeUidGid() is only useful for tests and would be unreachable
    code on a production system, it is only expected to be be implemented by the
    host operating systems.
