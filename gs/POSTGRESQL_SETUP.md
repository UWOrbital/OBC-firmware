## Database Setup

Run `sudo -u postgres psql --version` to check that it was installed properly. It should print that major version is 16.

Below are the commands to setup PostgreSQL for the ground station
```sh
sudo -u postgres psql # Connect to the PostgreSQL CLI
CREATE USER username WITH PASSWORD 'password' SUPERUSER;  -- Change username to your user on the machine and password to a strong password
CREATE DATABASE username; -- Change this to your username
# Log out of this session by pressing Ctrl + D
```
Log back in by running `psql` if username you created above matches the current user, you don't need to log in.
Otherwise, you will need to run `psql -U username` and then enter the password created above to proceed.
```sh
CREATE DATABASE gs; # gs database
\c gs; # Connect to the gs database
```

## Environment Variable Setup

Find the `gs/backend/config/template.env` and create a copy of it in the same directory with the name `.env`
Inside your newly created `.env` file, put your username and password created above inside the quotes for `GS_DATABASE_USER` and `GS_DATABASE_PASSWORD` respectively.

In the end your `.env` file, should look like this:
```sh
GS_DATABASE_USER="username"      # replace username with your created username
GS_DATABASE_PASSWORD="password"  # replace password with your created password above
GS_DATABASE_LOCATION="localhost" # Change this if using a remote server
GS_DATABASE_PORT="5432"          # Default PostgreSQL port. Change if needed
GS_DATABASE_NAME="gs"            # Name of the database. NOTE: Make sure to create this manually before running the backend of the first time
```

Note: You can choose to remove the first to lines of the `.env` that start with \# as those lines are comments.

Now, you can start the backend as by running `fastapi dev gs/backend/main.py` from the top level directory to run in development mode.
