## UW Orbital Docs
The UW Orbital Docs are a great source of codebase documentation. The site includes many detailed setup guides as well as code style guides. **We highly recommend following these guides if you are new to the team or software development in general.**

You will find it most helpful to check out the setup guides, build tutorials, and style guides.

Check out the site here: https://uworbital.github.io/OBC-firmware/

The documentation site now contains most of the information previously found in this README.

## Notion
The team Notion is another important source of information. Here you'll find other team documentation, onboarding info, and links to useful resources.

The software section of the Notion is available here: https://www.notion.so/uworbital/Software-a613c4aaa36449969010cabba2fc329d

## Firmware Dependencies

#### HALCoGen

Download HALCoGen here: https://www.ti.com/tool/HALCOGEN#downloads. This will be used for configuring the HAL. Unfortunately, the tool is only available on Windows. If you're on a non-Windows system, you may be able to set HALCoGen up in a Windows VM or someone else on the team can make HAL changes for you. We don't have to modify the HAL very often anyways.

#### Code Composer Studio (CCS)

Download Code Composer Studio (CCS): https://www.ti.com/tool/CCSTUDIO. This will be used for debugging.

#### Uniflash

Download UniFlash here: https://www.ti.com/tool/UNIFLASH#downloads. This will be used for flashing the RM46.
