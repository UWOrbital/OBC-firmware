## Getting Started

This section will explain how to set up the repo, and how to build, flash, and debug the code.

### Getting the Source

1. Check if you have Git installed on your system by running `git --version` in a terminal. If it returns some version number, then it's installed. If not, follow the installation steps listed [here](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git). If you're on Windows, it's highly recommended that you also install Git Bash and use that instead of the command prompt or Powershell.
2. To clone this project, run the following command in whatever directory you want to store the repository in:
```
git clone git@github.com:UWOrbital/OBC-firmware.git
```

### Dependencies

#### HALCoGen

Download HALCoGen here: https://www.ti.com/tool/HALCOGEN#downloads. This will be used for configuring the HAL. Unfortunately, the tool is only available on Windows. If you're on a non-Windows system, you may be able to set HALCoGen up in a Windows VM or someone else on the team can make HAL changes for you. We don't have to modify the HAL very often anyways.

#### Code Composer Studio (CCS)

Download Code Composer Studio (CCS): https://www.ti.com/tool/CCSTUDIO. This will be used for debugging.

#### Uniflash

Download UniFlash here: https://www.ti.com/tool/UNIFLASH#downloads. This will be used for flashing the RM46.

#### Docker Development Environment

It's **highly recommended** that you set up your development environment using Docker and VSCode, especially if you're new to software development. If you follow the instructions in this section, you can skip the **Windows/MacOS/Linux** sections. If you know what you're doing, feel free to set up your dev environment however you like using the instructions in the **Windows/MacOS/Linux** sections for reference. However, there may be a lack of support from other leads/members who don't use the same setup.

##### Docker Desktop Installation & Configuration
1. Install Docker Desktop App from [this link](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/)
    - You can choose to sign-up/create an account but it's not required. You can also skip the "Tell-us about what you do" section.
2. Open Docker Desktop and click on ```Dev Environments``` from the side-panel
    - Click on create on ```Create +``` in the top-right corner.
3. Setting up the repo
    - Name the Environment as desired
    - For the ```Choose source``` option, select ```Local directory``` and then select the `OBC-firmware` repository folder that you cloned earlier.
    - Click ```Continue```
    - Once the container is created, you should be able to open the container in VSCode. If you have VSCode, you can press ```Open in VSCode```. If you don't have VSCode, you can get it here: https://code.visualstudio.com/download

##### Installing Dependencies
Once you open the docker instance, open a terminal in VSCode and run the following commands. The dollar sign in your terminal should be prefaced by something like this: ```root ➜ /com.docker.devenvironments.code (main ✗)```.

This command opens a terminal in VSCode: ```Ctrl + Shift + ` ```

Enter these commands in your terminal:
```
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y python3-pip build-essential cmake
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
pre-commit install
```

##### Testing The Container Build

To test whether your Dev environment has been set up correctly run the commands in the **Building** section. The OBC firmware and test builds should pass. All tests should succeed.

**Note**: The docker container uses pre-configured git (one added to the original OS path by the user). So you should be able to pull and push to the OBC repo as necessary.

**Tip**: Use the ```git config --list``` command on the VsCode terminal to confirm your git info.

#### **Windows**
Skip this section if you set up a Docker development environment.

1. Download WSL2: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install

2. In WSL2, run the following:
    ```sh
    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install build-essential
    ```
3. Choose the environment where you'll be running `git commit` (either WSL2 or the host). In that environment, install Python 3.8+ and pip if they're not already installed. Then, run the following in the OBC-firmware directory:
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt # You may want to create a Python virtual env before this
    pre-commit install
    ```
    - You may receive a message in yellow saying where pre-commit.exe was installed and that you need to add it to PATH
        - To do this go to View advanced System settings -> Environment Variables -> Path -> Edit and click new to paste the path to where pre-commit.exe is                    installed into here. You may need to restart after doing this for the changes to take place.
    - Once your PATH is set up and pre-commit is installed you can use `pre-commit run --all-files` to format all of your files before committing
    **Note:** pre-commit is used to format your code whenever you make a commit.

You'll be using WSL2 primarily for building the firmware and running tests.

#### **MacOS**
Skip this section if you set up a Docker development environment.

Install required build tools (CMake, Make, gcc)
```sh
brew install cmake
brew install make
brew install gcc
```

Install Python 3.8+ and pip if they're not already installed, then run the following commands in the OBC-firmware directory:
```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt # You may want to create a Python virtual env before this
pre-commit install
```

#### **Linux**
Skip this section if you set up a Docker development environment.

Install required build tools (CMake, Make, gcc)
```sh
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install build-essential
```

Install Python 3.8+ and pip if they're not already installed, then run the following commands in the OBC-firmware directory:
```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt # You may want to create a Python virtual env before this
pre-commit install
```

### Building

#### **OBC Firmware**
From the top-level directory, run the following to build the OBC firmware.
```
mkdir build_arm && cd build_arm
cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=OBC
cmake --build .
```
Take a look at `cmake/fw_build_options.cmake` to see the available build options.

#### **Ground Station**
From the top-level directory, run the following to build the ground station. Currently, the ground station is only supported on Windows.
```
mkdir build_gs && cd build_gs
cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=GS
cmake --build .
```

#### **Tests**
From the top-level directory, run the following to build and run the tests.
```
mkdir build && cd build
cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Test
cmake --build .
ctest --verbose
```

### Flashing
To flash the RM46 (our microcontroller), we use Uniflash. Open Uniflash and select the appropriate device and connection.
#### **RM46 Launchpad:**
- Device = LAUNCHXL2-RM46
- Connection = Texas Instruments XDS110 USB Debug Probe

#### **OBC Revision 1/2:**
- Device = RM46L852
- Connection = Texas Instruments XDS110 USB Debug Probe

Then, click `Start` to begin a session. Select the `OBC-firmware.out` executable that you built (located in the `build_arm/` directory) and click `Load Image`. This will begin the flash process.

### Debugging
We use Code Composer Studio for debugging the firmware. **TODO**: Write a tutorial on how to use CCS.

## Contributing
1. Make sure you're added as a member to the UW Orbital organization on GitHub.
2. Create a feature branch for whatever task you're working on.
    * Our branch naming scheme is `<developer_name>/<feature_description>`.
      * Example: `danielg/implement-random-device-driver`
3. Make a PR.
    - For the PR description, make sure to fill in all the required details in the generated template.
    - Add at least 3 PR reviewers, including 1 firmware lead. When a PR is created, PR stats are added as a comment. You can use these stats to choose reviewers. Send a message in the #pr channel on Discord to notify the reviewers of your PR.
4. Make any requested changes and merge your branch onto main once the PR is approved.

## Style Guide

### Comments

#### Single Line Comments

Variable and function names should be descriptive enough to understand even without comments. Comments are needed to describe any complicated logic. You may use `//` or `/* */` for single line comments.

#### Function Comments

Function comments should exist in the .h file. For static functions, they should exist in the .c file. Function comments should follow the format shown below:
```c
/**
 * @brief Adds two numbers together
 *
 * @param num1 - The first number to add.
 * @param num2 - The second number to add.
 * @return Returns the sum of the two numbers.
 */
uint8_t addNumbers(uint8_t num1, uint8_t num2);
```

#### File Header Comments

- File comments are not required

#### Header Guard

We use `#pragma once` instead of include guards.

### ****Naming and typing conventions****

-   `variableNames` in camelCase
-   `functionNames()` in camelCase
-   `#define MACRO_NAME` in CAPITAL_SNAKE_CASE
-   `file_names` in snake_case
-   `type_defs` in snake_case with _t suffix
    -   Ex:
        ```c
        typedef struct {
          uint32_t a;
          uint32_t b;
        } struct_name_t
        ```
-   Import statements should be grouped in the following order:
    1.  Local imports (e.g. `#include "cc1120_driver.h`)
    2.  External library imports (e.g. `#include <os_semphr.h>`)
    3.  Standard library imports (e.g. `#include <stdint.h>`)

### ****General Rules****
Some of these rules don't apply in certain cases. Use your better judgement. To learn more about these rules, research NASA's Power of 10.

1. Avoid complex flow constructs, such as [goto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goto) and [recursion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recursion_(computer_science)).
2. All loops must have fixed bounds. This prevents runaway code.
3. Avoid [heap memory allocation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory_management#DYNAMIC).
4. Use an average of two [runtime assertions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assertion_(software_development)#Assertions_for_run-time_checking) per function.
5. Restrict the scope of data to the smallest possible.
6. Check the return value of all non-void functions, or cast to void to indicate the return value is useless.
7. Limit pointer use to a single [dereference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dereference_operator), and do not use [function pointers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_pointer).
8. Compile with all possible warnings active; all warnings should then be addressed before release of the software.
9. Use the preprocessor sparingly
10. Restrict functions to a single printed page
