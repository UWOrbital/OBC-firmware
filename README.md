## Getting Started

This section will explain how to set up the repo, and how to build, flash, and debug the code.

### Dependencies

The following software should be installed:
* GCC ARM Embedded Toolchain
* HALCoGen (Only on Windows machines)
* UniFlash
* Code Composer Studio

**Instructions on how to install these tools can be found on [this Notion page.](https://www.notion.so/uworbital/OBC-Firmware-Development-Workflow-ab037261ce6c45189ea5ca8486b02c6b)**

### Getting the Source

This project is [hosted on GitHub](https://github.com/UWOrbital/OBC-firmware). You can clone this project directly using this command:
```
git clone git@github.com:UWOrbital/OBC-firmware.git
```

### Building

You can build the project using these commands at the top-level of the repo:

```
make clean # Delete any previous build files
make # Build the .out file. It should appear in the build directory.
```
If you get a main() already defined error, go remove the file hal/source/sys_main.c.

More information can be found on [this Notion page.](https://www.notion.so/uworbital/OBC-Firmware-Development-Workflow-ab037261ce6c45189ea5ca8486b02c6b)

### Flashing and Debugging
Information about flashing the device and debugging can be found on [this Notion page.](https://www.notion.so/uworbital/OBC-Firmware-Development-Workflow-ab037261ce6c45189ea5ca8486b02c6b)

## Contributing
1. Make sure you're added as a member to the UW Orbital organization on GitHub.
2. Create a feature branch for whatever task you're working on.
    * Our branch naming scheme is `<subteam>/<developer_name>/<feature_description>`. Ignore the `<developer_name>` part if the branch has multiple developers.
    * Example: `cdh/daniel/implement-random-device-driver`
    * Another example: `cdh/implement-random-device-driver`
3. Make a PR. Make sure to at least add the CDH leads as reviewers and ping the CDH pr channel on Discord. You may also want to add your subteam lead(s) as a reviewer if you're not on CDH.
    * Pull requests should include information on, at minimum, the purpose of the PR, new changes made in the PR, tests performed to verify that the code works, and changes that can be made in future iterations of the feature. See [this sample template](https://github.com/UWOrbital/CC1120Driver/blob/main/.github/pull_request_template.md) for more. It’s good practice to have a PR template in a .github folder in every repository you create. GitHub will pull from this template every time a new PR is made.
5. Make any requested changes and merge your branch onto main once the PR is approved.

## Style Guide

### Comments

#### Single Line Comments

Variable and function names should be descriptive enough to understand even without comments. Comments are needed to describe any complicated logic. You may use `//` or `/* */` for single line comments. 

#### Function Comments

Function comments should exist in both the .h and .c files optimally, but at minimum they should be available in the .h files. Comments should follow the format shown below:
```c
/**
 * @brief Adds two numbers together
 * 
 * @param num1 - The first number to add.
 * @param num2 - The second number to add.
 * @return uint8_t - Returns the sum of of the two numbers.
 */
uint8_t add_numbers(uint8_t num1, uint8_t num2);
```

#### File Header Comments

- File comments are not required

#### Header Guard

- The symbol name should have the form `<PATH>_<FILE>_H_`

For example, if the file is `abc/xyz/foo.h`, then the header guard should be
```c
#ifndef ABC_XYZ_FOO_H_
#define ABC_XYZ_FOO_H_
...
#endif
```

### ****Naming and typing conventions****

-   `variableNames` in camelCase
-   `functionNames()` in camelCase
-   `CONSTANT_NAMES` in CAPITAL_SNAKE_CASE
-   `file_names` in snake_case
-   `type_defs` in snake_case with _t suffix
    -   Ex: 
        ```c
        typedef struct {
            int a;
            int b;
        } struct_name_t
        ```
-   4 spaces per level of indentation
-   Use spaces after opening brackets for conditionals and loops (e.g. `if ()` and `while ()`), but not for function calls (i.e. `my_func()`).
-   Operators:
    -   No spaces around `*`, `/`, `%`, `!`
    -   One space on either side of `=`, `==`, `+`, `-`, `+=`, `-=`, etc
    -   One space after every comma `my_func(var1, var2, var3)`
-   Import statments should be grouped in the following order:
    1.  Local imports (e.g. `#include "cc1120_driver.h`)
    2.  External library imports (e.g. `#include <semphr.h>`)
    3.  Standard library imports (e.g. `#include <stdint.h>`)
-   160 character limit per line (not a hard limit, use common sense)
-   Hanging indents should be aligned to delimeter:

```c
myFunction(hasToo,
            many, variables)
```

### ****General Rules****

1. Avoid complex flow constructs, such as [goto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goto) and [recursion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recursion_(computer_science)).
2. All loops must have fixed bounds. This prevents runaway code.
3. Avoid [heap memory allocation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory_management#DYNAMIC).
4. Use an average of two [runtime assertions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assertion_(software_development)#Assertions_for_run-time_checking) per function.
5. Restrict the scope of data to the smallest possible.
6. Check the return value of all non-void functions, or cast to void to indicate the return value is useless.
7. Limit pointer use to a single [dereference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dereference_operator), and do not use [function pointers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_pointer).
8. Compile with all possible warnings active; all warnings should then be addressed before release of the software.
