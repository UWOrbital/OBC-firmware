/** @brief Free inodes orphaned before the most recent mount.

    When the last directory entry referring to an inode is unlinked, but there
    are one or more open handles to that inode, the inode becomes orphaned.
    Reliance Edge keeps a list of these orphaned inodes.  When the last open
    handle for an orphaned inode is closed, the orphaned inode is freed.
    However, if the volume is not cleanly unmounted and transacted, either
    because unmount transactions are disabled, or red_umount2() is called with
    #RED_UMOUNT_FORCE, or due to power interruption or other system error, it is
    possible for the list of orphaned inodes to be non-empty when the volume is
    next mounted.  Reliance Edge will by default free all orphaned inodes at
    mount time.  However, doing so could make mount take much longer than
    normal.  Thus, red_mount2() accepts a #RED_MOUNT_SKIP_DELETE flag which will
    cause the orphaned inodes list to be moved to a special "defunct orphaned
    inodes" list, which contains only inodes which were orphaned before the most
    recent mount.  If the defunct orphaned inodes list is not empty, the two
    lists are concatenated, such that immediately after mounting, all orphans
    are in the defunct orphaned inodes list and the orphaned inodes list is
    empty.  This allows the file system to function as expected without freeing
    the orphaned inodes at mount time.

    When there are inodes in the defunct orphan list, and #RED_TRANSACT_VOLFULL
    is enabled, they will be freed automatically if the file system runs out of
    free inodes or free blocks, to reclaim space.

    This API provides a method to free defunct orphaned inodes at a convenient
    time, rather than paying the penalty during mount or write operations.

    @param pszVolume    The path prefix of the volume.
    @param ulCount      The maximum number of defunct orphans to free.  If there
                        are fewer than @p ulCount defunct orphans, all defunct
                        orphans will be freed.

    @return On success, zero is returned when all defunct orphans have been
            freed, and 1 is returned when defunct orphans remain.  On error, -1

    - #RED_O_EXCL: In combination with `RED_O_CREAT`, return an error if the

      #REDCONF_API_POSIX_FTRUNCATE is true.
    - #RED_O_NOFOLLOW: If the final path component is a symbolic link, return a
      #RED_ELOOP error rather than following it.  This flag has no effect except
      when #REDCONF_API_POSIX_SYMLINK and #REDOSCONF_SYMLINK_FOLLOW are both

    - #RED_O_SYMLINK: Expect the final path component to be a symbolic link and

      be accessed as if it were a file descriptor for a regular file.  With
      #RED_O_CREAT, this flag can be used to create a symbolic link.  This flag
      is only defined when #REDCONF_API_POSIX_SYMLINK is enabled.

    #RED_O_TRUNC is invalid with #RED_O_RDONLY.  #RED_O_EXCL is invalid without
    #RED_O_CREAT.  #RED_O_NOFOLLOW is invalid with #RED_O_SYMLINK.

    If the volume is read-only, #RED_O_RDONLY is the only valid open flag; use
    of any other flag will result in an error.

    If #RED_O_TRUNC frees data which is in the committed state, it will not
    return to free space until after a transaction point.

    The returned file descriptor must later be closed with red_close().

    Unlike POSIX open, other open flags (like `O_SYNC`) are not supported and
    the third argument for the permissions is not supported.  If RED_O_CREAT is
    specified in @p ulOpenFlags and the file does not exist, the permissions

/** @brief Read the contents of a symbolic link.

    @note On success, @p pszBuffer will be null-terminated by this function if
          @p ulBufferSize exceeded the length of the target path stored for
          @p pszSymlink.  This differs from the readlink() implementations in
          most POSIX-like systems (such as Linux and the *BSDs), which _never_
          include the null-terminator.  If @p ulBufferSize is less than or equal
          to the length of the target path, the @p pszBuffer will _not_ be
          null-terminated by this function.

    The caller must handle the case where the symbolic link target was too large
    to fit into the buffer.  This can be done by looking for a return value
    which is equal to @p ulBufferSize.  For example:

    @code{.c}
    char szBuffer[256];
    int32_t len;

    len = red_readlink(pszSymlink, szBuffer, sizeof(szBuffer));
    if(len == (int32_t)sizeof(szBuffer))
    {
        // Optionally return an error
        err = RED_ENAMETOOLONG;
        // Optionally null-terminate the buffer to use the truncated target path
        szBuffer[sizeof(szBuffer) - 1U] = '\0';
    }
    @endcode

    @param pszSymlink   The path to the symbolic link to read.
    @param pszBuffer    The buffer to populate with the target of the the
                        symbolic link.
    @param ulBufferSize The size of @p pszBuffer, in bytes.  If the length of
                        the symbolic link target is greater than or equal to the
                        value, then the target string is truncated and no null
                        terminator is written to @p pszBuffer.

    @return On success, returns the length of the symlink target (not including
            any null-terminator) or @p ulBufferSize, whichever is smaller.  On
            error, -1 is returned and #red_errno is set appropriately.

                /*  The POSIX readlink() specification is somewhat vague, but
                    most implementations (including Linux and the *BSDs) do
                    the following: read the contents of the symlink (_not_
                    including the NUL terminator) into the buffer and return
                    the number of bytes copied into the buffer.  The buffer
                    is *never* NUL terminated, even if there is room for a NUL.
                    This is a poor API, since in most cases the callers will
                    need to NUL-terminate the string to use it, and failure to
                    do so could lead to subtle bugs.

                    red_symlink() (unlike most implementations) will write
                    the NUL terminator to disk as part of the file data for
                    the symlink.  However, we can't assume that the symlink
                    is NUL terminated.  Reliance Edge has the RED_O_SYMLINK
                    extension which allows symlinks to be opened as file
                    descriptors and to have arbitrary contents written into
                    them.  This means that the symlinks might not end with a
                    NUL, or it might have a NUL character before the EOF.

                    So -- as a compromise between POSIX compliance, convenience,
                    and Reliance Edge's extensions -- we do the following:
                */

                        RED_O_SYMLINK.

                        The typical readlink() implementation never writes the
                        NUL, whether or not there's room for it, but we are
                        deliberately deviating from that.

                        treated as the "end" of the symlink.  This means that
                        bytes after &pszBuffer[<return value>] are potentially
                        modified by this function.  This is allowed by POSIX,

                        it exists on disk) is _not_ included in the returned
                        length.  This makes the red_readlink() return value

    If the path names a directory which is not empty, the unlink will fail.

    If the deletion frees data in the committed state, it will not return to

/** @brief Change the access and modification times of the file or directory,

    This function is similar to red_utimes(), except that it optionally supports
    parsing a relative path starting from a directory specified via file
    descriptor.

    @param iDirFildes   File descriptor for the directory from which @p pszPath,
                        if it is a relative path, should be parsed.  May also be
                        one of the pseudo file descriptors: #RED_AT_FDCWD,
                        #RED_AT_FDABS, or #RED_AT_FDNONE; see the documentation
                        of those macros for details.
    @param pszPath      The name and location of the file or directory to change
                        the times of.  This may be an absolute path, in which
                        case @p iDirFildes is ignored; or it may be a relative
                        path, in which case it is parsed with @p iDirFildes as
                        the starting point.
    @param pulTimes     Pointer to an array of two timestamps, expressed as the
                        number of seconds since 1970-01-01, where @p pulTimes[0]
                        specifies the new access time and @p pulTimes[1]

                        directory are set to the current time.
    @param ulFlags      Utimes flags.  The only flag value is
                        #RED_AT_SYMLINK_NOFOLLOW, which means that if @p pszPath
                        names a symbolic link, change the timestamps of the
                        symbolic link itself rather than what the link points

/** @brief Delete a directory.

    The given directory name is deleted and the corresponding directory inode
    will be deleted.

    If #REDCONF_DELETE_OPEN is true, then deleting a directory with open handles
    (file descriptors or directory streams) works as in POSIX rmdir.  If
    #REDCONF_DELETE_OPEN is false, then unlike  POSIX rmdir, deleting a
    directory with open handles will fail with an #RED_EBUSY error.

    If the path names a directory which is not empty, the deletion will fail.
    If the path names the root directory of a file system volume, the deletion
    will fail.

    If the path names a regular file, the deletion will fail.  This provides
    type checking and may be useful in cases where an application knows the path
    to be deleted should name a directory.

    If the deletion frees data in the committed state, it will not return to
    free space until after a transaction point.

    Unlike POSIX rmdir, this function can fail when the disk is full.  To fix
    this, transact and try again: Reliance Edge guarantees that it is possible
    to delete at least one file or directory after a transaction point.  If disk
    full automatic transactions are enabled, this will happen automatically.

    @param pszPath  The path of the directory to delete.

/** @brief Rename a file or directory.

    Both paths must reside on the same file system volume.  Attempting to use
    this API to move a file to a different volume will result in an error.

    If @p pszNewPath names an existing file or directory, the behavior depends
    on the configuration.  If #REDCONF_RENAME_ATOMIC is false, and if the
    destination name exists, this function always fails and sets #red_errno to
    #RED_EEXIST.  This behavior is contrary to POSIX.

    If #REDCONF_RENAME_ATOMIC is true, and if the new name exists, then in one
    atomic operation, @p pszNewPath is unlinked and @p pszOldPath is renamed to
    @p pszNewPath.  Both @p pszNewPath and @p pszOldPath must be of the same
    type (both files or both directories).  As with red_unlink(), if
    @p pszNewPath is a directory, it must be empty.  The major exception to this
    behavior is that if both @p pszOldPath and @p pszNewPath are links to the
    same inode, then the rename does nothing and both names continue to exist.
    If @p pszNewPath points to an inode with a link count of one and open
    handles (file descriptors or directory streams), then:
    - If #REDCONF_DELETE_OPEN is true, then the rename succeeds as with POSIX
      rename.
    - If #REDCONF_DELETE_OPEN is false, then unlike POSIX rename, the rename
      will fail with #RED_EBUSY.

    If the rename deletes the old destination, it may free data in the committed
    state, which will not return to free space until after a transaction point.
    Similarly, if the deleted inode was part of the committed state, the inode
    slot will not be available until after a transaction point.

    @param pszOldPath   The path of the file or directory to rename.

    This function is similar to red_link(), except that it optionally supports

    See red_link() for further details on renaming which also apply to this
    function.

    @param iDirFildes           File descriptor for the directory from which

                                be parsed.  May also be one of the pseudo file

                                #RED_AT_FDNONE; see the documentation of those
                                macros for details.
    @param pszPath              The path indicating the inode for the new link.
                                This may be an absolute path, in which case
                                @p iDirFildes is ignored; or it may be a
                                relative path, in which case it is parsed with
                                @p iDirFildes as the starting point.
    @param iHardLinkDirFildes   File descriptor for the directory from which
                                @p pszHardLink, if it is a relative path, should
                                be parsed.  May also be one of the pseudo file

                                equal to @p iDirFildes.
    @param pszHardLink          The name and location for the new link.  This
                                may be an absolute path or a relative path, just
                                like @p pszPath, except that relative paths are

                                starting point.

                                #RED_AT_SYMLINK_FOLLOW, which means that if
                                @p pszPath names a symbolic link, follow the
                                symbolic link and create a hard link to what it
                                resolves to, rather than creating a hard link
                                which points at the symbolic link itself.  The

    The file offset of the @p iFildes file descriptor is set to @p llOffset,
    relative to some starting position.  The available positions are:

    - ::RED_SEEK_SET Seek from the start of the file.  In other words,
      @p llOffset becomes the new file offset.
    - ::RED_SEEK_CUR Seek from the current file offset.  In other words,
      @p llOffset is added to the current file offset.
    - ::RED_SEEK_END Seek from the end-of-file.  In other words, the new file
      offset is the file size plus @p llOffset.

    Since @p llOffset is signed (can be negative), it is possible to seek
    backward with ::RED_SEEK_CUR or ::RED_SEEK_END.

    It is permitted to seek beyond the end-of-file; this does not increase the
    file size (a subsequent red_write() call would).

    Unlike POSIX lseek, this function cannot be used with directory file
    descriptors.

    @param iFildes  The file descriptor whose offset is to be updated.
    @param llOffset The new file offset, relative to @p whence.
    @param whence   The location from which @p llOffset should be applied.

    @return On success, returns the new file position, measured in bytes from

    The intended use case for this function is when an application intends to
    write a file of a known size and wants to ensure ahead-of-time that there is
    space to write the entire file.

    This function will increase the file size to @p ullSize and reserve space to
    allow writing the region between the old file size and @p ullSize.  The
    reserved area may _only_ be written sequentially.  The writes may occur via
    multiple file descriptors, but the writes to the underlying inode must be
    sequential.  When the entire reserved area has been written, the file may
    once again be written non-sequentially.

    The space reservation is _not_ persistent.  The reservation goes away when:
    -# All file descriptors for the underlying inode are closed.
    -# The file is truncated via red_ftruncate().
    -# When the volume is unmounted.
    -# After an unclean shutdown (power loss or system failure).

    If, after using this function, the application determines that not all of
    the reserved space is needed, the file can be truncated with red_ftruncate()
    to correct the file size and unreserve the unneeded space.

    The value of the file offset in the file descriptor is not modified by this
    function.

    @param iFildes  The file descriptor of the file for which to reserve space.

                In Reliance Edge, the directory position is the index of the
                directory entry.  The values returned by red_telldir() will be
                between 0 and the dirent count (inclusive).  However, it's
                possible that the directory size was larger when red_telldir()
                was invoked, so ulPosition could be between 0 and max dirent
                count (inclusive).  It's not a problem if ulPosition is beyond
                the end of the directory, since when given such a position,
                red_readdir() will behave just like the position is _at_ the end
                of the directory.

                ulPosition is technically invalid if it is larger than max
                dirent count.  However, computing that upper limit from here
                would be awkward, and we have no way to return an error anyway.
                So we don't worry about it: even if ulPosition is larger than
                red_telldir() will ever return, go ahead and set it in the
                handle.  For red_readdir(), any position beyond the end of the
                directory is equivalent to being at the end of the directory,
                even impossibly high positions.  Ignoring an erroneous position
                is acceptable, because POSIX allows any behavior for invalid
                positions.

                    rather than as a string, which has several advantages: it
                    saves memory, avoids the need to impose a maximum path
                    length, makes relative path operations faster since the CWD
                    does not need to be resolved every time, and makes it easy
                    to allow renaming and disallow deleting the CWD.  The
                    disadvantage is that getcwd() (this function) is more
                    complicated, because the CWD buffer must be constructed.
                    This construction is possible since each directory inode
                    stores the inode number of its parent directory (only one
                    parent: no hard links allowed for directories), so for the
                    CWD inode we can step up to its parent, then scan that
                    parent directory for the name which corresponds to the
                    inode. Iteratively we can repeat this process to construct
                    the CWD in reverse, starting with the deepest subdirectory
                    and working up toward the root directory.  This is
                    potentially a slow operation if the directories are large
                    and thus slow to scan.

/** @brief Pointer to where the last file system error (errno) is stored.

    This function is intended to be used via the #red_errno macro, or a similar
    user-defined macro, that can be used both as an lvalue (writable) and an
    rvalue (readable).

    Under normal circumstances, the errno for each task is stored in a
    different location.  Applications do not need to worry about one task
    obliterating an error value that another task needed to read.  This task
    errno is initially zero.  When one of the POSIX-like APIs returns an
    indication of error, the location for the calling task will be populated
    with the error value.

    In some circumstances, this function will return a pointer to a global
    errno location which is shared by multiple tasks.  If the calling task is
    not registered as a file system user and all of the task slots are full,
    there can be no task-specific errno, so the global pointer is returned.
    Likewise, if the file system driver is uninitialized, there are no
    registered file system users and this function always returns the pointer
    to the global errno.  Under these circumstances, multiple tasks
    manipulating errno could be problematic.

    This function never returns `NULL` under any circumstances.  The #red_errno
    macro unconditionally dereferences the return value from this function, so
    returning `NULL` could result in a fault.

    @return Pointer to where the errno value is stored for this task.
