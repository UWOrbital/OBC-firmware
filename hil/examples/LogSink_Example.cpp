/*
@brief  Simple LogSink unit test flow for validating integrated software on hardware ie. LM75BD log validation on the
Rev1 board. Generated Logs simply checks if any logs have been outputed, Number Logs validates the number of logs after
running for a duration, Specific Logs validates if the LogSink fetched a certain log, and Timeframe Logs validates the
file output speed of the logs.
