This guide will help you install and setup PostgreSQL for hosting the database locally.

## Windows
:::caution
**Windows is not supported for firmware and ground station development.**

If you are using Windows, you will need to install Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL). WSL lets you run a complete Linux environment directly inside Windows without virtual machine overhead or dual booting.

Make sure you follow the [Initial setup](/OBC-firmware/start-here/initial-setup) guide.

## Linux/WSL

<Steps>
1. Open a terminal and run the following commands to install PostgreSQL:

    ```shell
    sudo apt update
    sudo apt install postgresql-16
    ```

2. Run `sudo -u postgres psql --version` to ensure PostgreSQL was installed properly. It should print that the major version is 16.

3. Run the following commands to setup PostgreSQL for the ground station.
    :::caution
    Make your PostgreSQL username the same as your Linux username.
    Also, try not to include special characters in your password as it may break connection strings.
    :::

    ```shell
    # Connect to PostgreSQL CLI as the postgres superuser
    sudo -u postgres psql
    # Replace your_username and your_password with your desired values
    CREATE USER your_username WITH PASSWORD 'your_password' SUPERUSER;
    CREATE DATABASE gs;
    ```

4. Log out, then verify that you can log in to your newly created user and database:

    ```shell
    \q # Log out
    # Replace your_username with your actual username
    psql -U your_username -d gs
    # You should be logged into the database
    \q # Log out again

5. From the root directory, run the following commands to create a new `.env` file:

    ```shell
    cd gs/backend/config
    cp template.env .env
    ```

6. Edit the `.env` file to add your login details in the quotes. In Linux/WSL, you can use `vim` or `nano`.

7. From the root directory, run the following command to initialize your database with the correct schema:

    ```shell
    alembic upgrade head
    ```

8. Ensure that your Python virtual environment is activated. If not, follow [Initial setup](/OBC-firmware/start-here/initial-setup). Start the backend in development mode by running `fastapi dev gs/backend/main.py` from the root directory. This will also initialize the database.
