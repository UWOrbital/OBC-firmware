The following are the steps members should take when looking for and completing new tasks!

<Steps>

1. Ensure that you have confirmed with a Lead or Project Manager that the task is available to take and that you are able to work on said task

2. When starting on your task branch from the main repository and name your branch in the format: `name/taskname`. For example a branch name could be `adityya/add-docs`. This helps us track branches!

3. Work on your task and add everything needed to get your task to a point where it is ready for a preliminary review.

4. When ready for review, create a pull request on Github. Be sure to fill out the pull request template provided!

5. Check if all github CI/CD checks all pass. If not address the errors!

6. Once you have verified that all CI/CD checks pass and have proof read your code you can create a new post in the `#pr` channel on discord. Refer to the example post on how to format your post.
    1. Make sure to assign the appropriate tags, `GS Backend`, `GS Frontend` or `Firmware`, to your PR post!
    2. Make sure to ping the software leads or project managers to review your PR!

7. Wait for the leads to review and address any comments!

8. Once a lead has approved your PR, you can merge it into the main branch!

</Steps>

Happy Coding!
