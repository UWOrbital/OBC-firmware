This guide walks you through the process of setting up your development environment.

## Windows
:::caution[]
**Windows is not supported for firmware and ground station development.**

If you are using Windows, you will need to install Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL). WSL lets you run a complete Linux environment directly inside Windows without virtual machine overhead or dual booting.

After installing WSL, continue to the [Linux/WSL](#linuxwsl) section of the guide.

### WSL installation

Follow Microsoft's official guide to install WSL: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install. Make sure you install the latest Ubuntu distribution for consistency (this should be the default). You can use another distribution, but note that some steps may differ, most notably package installation.

## Linux/WSL

<Steps>
1. Ensure you have Git installed. If you are using Ubuntu 24.04 LTS or later, or installed the default WSL distribution, you should already have it installed.
If not, open a terminal and run the following commands to install Git:

    ```shell
    sudo apt update
    sudo apt install git
    ```

2. Run the following command in a directory of your choice to clone the repository:
    ```shell
    git clone https://github.com/UWOrbital/OBC-firmware.git
    ```

3. Install our required tools:

    ```shell
    sudo apt update
    sudo apt install -y build-essential gcc-multilib g++-multilib cmake curl
    ```

4. Install Python 3.11+. If you are using Ubuntu 24.04 LTS or later, or installed the default WSL distribution, you should already have a compatible version of Python installed.

    ```shell
    sudo apt install python3
    ```
    
    Check your installed Python version with:
    ```shell
    python3 --version
    ```
    If it's 3.11 or higher, you're good.

5. Install the Python virtual environment:

    ```shell
    sudo apt install python3-venv
    ```

6. Setup your virtual environment by running the following commands in the repository's root directory (the `OBC-firmware` folder):

    ```shell
    python3 -m venv .venv
    source .venv/bin/activate
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    pip install -e .

7. Setup the pre-commit by running the following commands in the repository's root directory. You may need to install unzip in order to install Deno. If you do not have unzip, run `sudo apt install unzip`.

    ```shell
    # The first command installs Deno, which is required for our pre-commit
    curl -fsSL https://deno.land/install.sh | sh
    pre-commit install
    ```

8. 
    :::note[Ground station only]
    Setup the PostgreSQL database with the [Database setup](/OBC-firmware/start-here/database-setup) guide.
