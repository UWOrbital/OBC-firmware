The following is a simple guide on building the app for the OBC.

<Steps>
1. Before compiling, ensure that the Python virtual environment is activated. If you do not have this configured, see [Initial setup](/OBC-firmware/start-here/initial-setup/).
2. From the root directory, run the following commands:
    ```shell
    mkdir -p build_arm && cd build_arm
    cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=OBC
    cmake --build .
    ```

    :::tip[Tip: Reducing build time]{icon="setting"}
    The `cmake --build .` takes some time to run since it is using a single thread to compile. To speed up the process we can replace it with one of the following commands:
    1. `make -j 16` (Recommended for most systems)
    2. `make -j 32` (This is faster but depends on if your system can handle 32 parallel jobs)
    :::
3. There are also plenty of extra options that you can use besides `-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE` by appending them to the `cmake ..` command. Take a look at the [CMake options guide](/OBC-firmware/builds/cmake-options/).

    :::caution
    Make sure to specify the `-DBOARD_TYPE=` option to avoid any unwanted behaviour.
