The following guide outlines a procedure to build the ground station.

## Compiling for the ground station
From the root directory, run the following commands:
```shell
mkdir -p build_gs && cd build_gs
cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=GS
cmake --build .
```

:::tip[Tip: Reducing Build Time]{icon="setting"}
The `cmake --build .` takes some time to run since it is using a single thread to compile. To speed up the process we can replace it with one of the following commands:
1. `make -j 16` (Recommended for most systems)
2. `make -j 32` (This is faster but depends on if your system can handle 32 parallel jobs)

## Setting up frontend development
To run the frontend, Deno must be installed. If it isn't, see [Initial setup](/OBC-firmware/start-here/initial-setup/) and follow it to set up the database as well.

Run all commands from the root directory.

:::note
If you have issues running any Deno commands, try restarting your shell after installing Deno.
